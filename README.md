# Healthcare Analytics

In this Project we use a processed version of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset that contains information relating to patients admitted 
to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. In order to analyze and present the data we perform the following tasks.

* Under `Data_Science/` we perform an initial exploratory data analysis and process of the data. Next, we work on the modeling and its evaluation.

* Under `Flask_Basic_ELements/` we implement an API to provide a machine friendly access and management of the data.

* Lastly, under `Front_with_React/` we build a web-based user-interface that will allow a user to interact and perform various actions.
