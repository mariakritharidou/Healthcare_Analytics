          <h2>The data</h2>
          <p>The given dataset is a processed version of the <a href='https://mimic.physionet.org/'>Medical Information Mart for 
          Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset</a> that contains information relating to patients admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital.</p>
          <p>The original MIMIC dataset consists of 28 tables with millions of entries. One
          very popular analysis performed on this dataset is to try to correlate the
          patientsâ€™ interactions with the with the hospital with the duration of their
          hospitalization.</p>          
          <p> The dataset that we use in this application contains nearly 50.000 hospital admissions, including
          the duration of their hospitalization (which we try to predict).</p>
          <h2>Stats</h2>
          <p>Stats tab provide meaningful aggregations based on the dataset.</p>
          <h2>Models</h2>
          <p>The goal of this task is to predict the duration that a patient is hospitalized.</p>
          <p>Models tab accept the data for an
          individual patient, in the format of the original file and return the predicted duration of
          hospitalization for that patient. </p>
          <h2>Application architecture</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A React client posts and gets JSON files to a Flask API</li>
            <li>A Flask API is responsible for:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Fetching the preprocessed data table.</li>
              <li>Sending stats information in JSON format to be rendered by the React Client.</li>
              <li>Receiving requests, processing the data in the correct form, predicting the hospitalization days and sending it back in JSON format to the React client.</li>
